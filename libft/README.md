# libft from @42 school of code

What's more in this libft ?
* Kernel linux list from linus git, but here with the respect of 42 norm.
  * circular list double linked.
* cliopts  in POSIX spirit.
  * a great command line parser for yours argc argv
* ft_perror, that you must use with cliopts
* some standard 42 project (printf, gnl)
* . . .

What's useless (so you need it) in this libft ?
* Amazing Makefile display, with a multi-colorized progress bar.
  * Ok, Makefile beauty doesn't matter, but just look at this one.
  * Makefile don't relink and recompile just what need. When changing a .c or .h you don't need to `make re`
